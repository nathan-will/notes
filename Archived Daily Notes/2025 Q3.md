	- Sort or understand SetString being use in images_registry_location and in the main service.

08/10/25
- For cloud options, just check regex
	- Lightweight sanity check
- for image registry location:
	- Your string looks incorrect, for x reasons, do you want to correct it?
- contsiner engine prompt - move validation inside service file
	- when exit know answer is corect
- user_input_service.go
	- Keep the SetString part in the service file, reduce scope of logic in
	- move validateOutput directly 
	- Create public method for do you want to try again, bool
		- Use utils.go - change promptfor Boolean to public method, then update interfaces and headers
	- Rename PromptForConfigSettings per PR feedback

- GCP AR failed push:
```
  failed to transfer biomodal resources: failed to transfer the pipeline modules: failed to transfer container '{biomodal_collapse 0.1.0}': failed to upload container: push failed for europe-west2-docker.pkg.dev/cli-testing-404/biomodal_collapse:0.1.0: docker push error: name unknown: Repository "biomodal_collapse" not found
```
^^ might not be clear to the user what's wrong here, so validating the registry might be a better approach.
This still doesn't solve the problem if there's another error in the push, so needs more testing

```
- GCP init, instance dir is prepended?
- TL:DR, jumped gun with PR, tests hadn;t been done and some things were wrong, FASTQ checking not implemented
- Ref genome download checks not working?

- Reference location error - running CLI locally
Summary of changes:
- `e2e_test.yaml` Update E2E test, HPC no longer valid executor, changed to local which the GHA can support.
- `duet_validate_inputs.go`: add bool for `--dry-run` flag, 
- main.go: UserFileRepository added to pipelineservice so that file_repository can be used
- `file_repository/main.go`: Add new platformAware functions for given platform. Add `getPlatformFromPath` to handle instances where a user wants to output to local filesystem but get input files from bucket.
- `platform_aware_methods` funcs for; validate input & output dirs, check storage space. Latter added to GCP for consistency but has no functional use.
- `duet_dry-run`: logic added to call respective file repo functions

	- executor missing } from nextflow override
	- params, registry, what's going on here. Would this not set the nextflow registry?
```
params {
    // The following is the configuration for the biomodal Docker registry
    // Set the registry to the appropriate region for your use case:
    // Use "us-docker.pkg.dev/cegx-releases/us-prod" for US
    // Use "eu-docker.pkg.dev/cegx-releases/eu-prod" for EU
    // Use "asia-docker.pkg.dev/cegx-releases/asia-prod" for Asia
    registry = "us-docker.pkg.dev/cegx-releases/us-prod"
    //registry = "eu-docker.pkg.dev/cegx-releases/eu-prod"
    //registry = "asia-docker.pkg.dev/cegx-releases/asia-prod"
