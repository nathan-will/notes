### Todo

- GHA for Python testing
- Run pre-commit on both repo's 2 X PR
- Push to pypi ready to go on branch for quick switchover
- Terraform for temp project, and open docker(?)
- Getting started documentation
	- Sample run data? Quickest way to getting this running?
	- Running Sphinx to auto generate .md in coda repo
	- Sphinx - used for deep docs
	- Incorporating notebooks - standalone or open repo?
	- GHA for sphinx
- ASM - new repo, how will feature branches be managed? Reminder on this
- Q2Z
	- Changes quant files to zarr, which coda uses
	- Remove all or a lot of the Python, just make it docker images repo dependent on coda (which gets built)
	- quant2zarr dockerfile - strip all the poetry out and build
	- move modules/ templates to docker dirs
	- Docker builds when package is pushed to cegx-pypi
- Tower runs?
	



Performance rewrite
- Initiative in helping DS
- Add the above as a specific thing in the below:
OLD
  Proactive in calling out improvements such as further testing on HPC and CLI improvments. Sometimes it's difficult to slow down and see the wood for the trees. To build on this we should keep pushing the importance of platform testing with new and old products, including expanding coverage of CI/CD.


NEW
Proactive in calling out improvements such as further testing on HPC and CLI improvements, took initiative on helping data science with their CI/CD issues and developer tooling, used to spearhead wider initiative. To build on this we should keep pushing the importance of platform testing with new and old products, including expanding coverage of CI/CD.


OLD:
Good knowledge of GCP, often the 'go-to' person, likes to be helpful. A relatively broad understanding of nextflow and the Tower, with a reasonable understanding of the pipeline and the business. Improving foundational programming knowledge will help leverage previous experience more effectively, along with system design and its principles.

NEW:
