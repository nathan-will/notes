- TODO:
	- Fix for /dev/stderr
	- Improve help functions: biomodal list WHAT
	- biomodal auth sanity check: prompted for uname & pwd even with env vars present (and in config)
- 
- Test list in E2E
- Import new DB

Notes:
```
query := &storage.Query{

Prefix: prefix,

Delimiter: "/", // This makes the listing work like 'ls' instead of recursive

}
```
- Presumably, this previously recursed into directories, EBS will want to preserve this

10/01/25
- Binary/ integration fix issues:
	- config file writing and expected location, how exactly does this work now?
	- For example:
	- `panic: Failed to get config: Failed to parse config file: Failed to read file: open /home/runner/work/biomodal_go_cli/biomodal_go_cli/biomodal/config.yaml: no such file or directory`
	- Somewhat solved but there are likely bugs in the init controller, more safety could be added
	- Now gets to test but is running as in local mode - fix:
