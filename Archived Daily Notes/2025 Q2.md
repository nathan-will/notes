- Tower upgrade remediation

Just to summarise for the thread, what's been tried so far:
- Batch, with either service account, works first time with a basic config
- GLS, with either service account still fails
- GLS with the Tower service account (sa-chiron-nextflow-tower@prj-biomodal-chiron.iam.gserviceaccount.com - both compute env and set in config), with all the Cloud LifeSciences permissions still fails.
- GLS quotas are not being hit in the project
I have not looked at all the changes between nxf_ver 23.04-25.04
