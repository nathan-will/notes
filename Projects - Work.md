## Ideas/ Skunkworks:


### AI based
- Instructions for Go CLI ala: https://github.com/ruvnet/claude-flow/wiki/CLAUDE-MD-Rust
- Agentic AI - trained on nextflow.log files - use diagnostic bundle
	- modality .github/agents
	- https://github.com/cegx-ds/modality/pull/850
		- Add prompts
	- https://github.com/cegx-ds/modality/pull/850

### Cost saving and tracking

- Billing dashboard
- Streamline VM creation process
	- Using pods in a cluster instead of VM's?
		- Not really intended use
	- Infrastructure manager, with some kind of frontend
- Fix cross-platform
- Cross-project C&A + BFX development - streamlining
- K8's for more apps internally, backstage PoC?

### Monitoring & Logging

- Monitoring to catch early warning
- @ people when CI/ Builds fail
	- Slack alerting - daily cron of what actions have failed and where they need attention
- Terraform CDK with Go or Python
- Look at Crossplane
	- K8's config with GitOps

### CI/CD
- Containers:
	- Make smaller
	- @ people for security issues
	- Automatic remediation?
