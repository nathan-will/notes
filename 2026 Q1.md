- Looking into cloud billing:

Description:
To give better control over spend, we want to set-up billing alerts, so when we see a spike in cost, an alert is surfaced to say which SKU in which project is spiking, and by how much.

This should be able to work in/ with biomodal-billing-viewer, this is example of what we're trying to replicate. A slackbot alerts the channel, with a link to the 3rd parties billing viewer hosted by them. As they don't have alerts set-up in our tenant, this much be DB driven? Question is, does our implementation need to be? Could we reconcile a cloud alert to be picked up in the billing-viewer.
