## How do you feel about your current role?
## What do you see as your next career step or goal and what do you need to get there?

Overall good. My next step as a career goal is to move to a Senior role, whilst I overall feel I am there, perhaps ownership of some larger projects would help make the case.

## Identify any areas of change or things you would like managed differently in the future.
