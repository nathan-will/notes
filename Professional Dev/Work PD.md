### 2025 Q3 PD Plan

Q: Self-assessment part 1. (Evaluate your personal and professional interests, any hopes, plans, and dreams you have for your career.)

A: Remain excited by the core DevOps stack, scalable engineering, automation, and building tools users want to use that make their daily lives better. In particular, helping solve problems in biotech with technology. A niche of interest there is how we can leverage gen AI to solve challenges specific to a business (such as training and deploying models to produce a local knowledge base), and how data engineering can speed up the time from data generation to an 'answer').

Q: Self-assessment part 2. (Evaluate your current knowledge and skillset.)

A: I feel I have a good knowledge of core DevOps principles, adequate ability with CI/CD, but still lack a proper understanding of full-stack development including foundational principles such as data structures. In addition I am actively pursuing training in Kubernetes and hope to deploy something that leverages K8's internally (and in my homelab).

Q: Your career goals. (Break up your main goals: set long-term, mid-term, and short-term goals. Remember to use the SMART goal technique to ensure that your goals are specific, measurable, achievable, relevant, and timebound.)

Long: Reach I/C level, having assisted in the writing and deployment of tools or services that benefit 1000's of users. Multi-cloud + HPC guru. Good knowledge and ability in 2 languages. Aim 3-5 years.

Mid: Solid foundation in either Go or Python with solid foundational programming knowledge, having deployed full-stack solutions used by many individually or as part of a team. This could be an internal or external tool. Solid resume of turning requirements into solutions (2-3 large scale projects). Aim would be 2-3 years.

Short: Move up to Snr DevOps level, known for deploying helpful solutions internally, and developing tools that save internal users hours of time per week. Contributing to customer success. Aim: within next year.


Q: How can you achieve your goals? (Take a look at your current skillset or position, as well as your goals, and identify any gaps. Write down what you need to do to get where you want to be.)

A: Continue training and professional use of K8's, hopefully with the opportunity to lead on deployment of software which leverages it. Undertaking professional training in full-stack development. Leading a project from requirements gathering to delivery and maintenance, full SDLC.

Q: Support. (How can we help you achieve your goals? Perhaps it's attending a conference to broaden your knowledge or helping you find a mentor.)

A: Continue providing resources for training and time to do it, being asked to lead or given opportunity to put my hand and lead smaller projects.

Q: Support. (How can we help you achieve your goals? Perhaps it's attending a conference to broaden your knowledge or helping you find a mentor.)

A: Quarterly or twice-yearly should be fine.

Q: Development actions/steps/activities. (E.g. setting PDP goals in the BOB Goals Section for easier tracking; researching available conferences; or reviewing resources on LITvideobooks.)

A: Could track training progress here, however the company offered training isn't of much use to my aspirations.

Q: Considering the current CT Growth Framework, try to identify (up to 3) areas where you already preform at the next level

A: 1. Seqera Platform and Batch maintenance, improvement and support saves users time and frustration
2. Assist with development of next-gen customer solutions (latch + CLI) to save support time internally and reduce customer frustrations
Q: Considering the current CT Growth Framework, try to identify (up to 3) areas where you need to improve to preform at the next level
A: 1. Take more initiative in showing interest/ asking to lead projects where possible.
